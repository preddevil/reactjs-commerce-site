# reactjs-commerce-site
Similar to angular2-commerce-site but built using ReactJS + Webpack 2

Features:

- CSS Modules: each React component has a separate scss file that does not pollute the global scope.
- Global CSS: global styles that applied application-wide
- Router Config: all routes are centralized into one file called routes.js; RoutesContainer plays a role in abstracting the routes details of the app.
- Redux Store
- Hot Module Replacement
- Webpack 2
- React-Router 4
